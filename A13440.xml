            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The 12. of Ianuary in the morning about 4. of the clocke we had better ≈øight of the Sattie, and we perceiued that ≈øhe ≈øtood in to get betwixt the ≈øhore and vs, which made vs doubt ≈øhe had more fellowes not far off, as not long after wee found: the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. pre≈øently ≈øent one to the top ma≈øt head who pre≈øently di≈øcouered 5.

            <p>The≈øe cheerfull words had been ≈øufficient to put courage into faint hartles Cowards: but much more it emboldened vs that were feareles before, for wee all expected greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make proofe of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe: at which the Mai≈øter cau≈øed his Trumpets twice to haile them, but they not regarding vs, ≈øcornd to an≈øwer vs, then the M. went vp the poop and waued his ≈øword 3. or 4. times ouer his head, brandi≈øhing it with ≈øuch dreadles re≈øolution, as if the day had beene ours already: then the Trumpets ≈øounded a charge, which warlik noy≈øe in≈øpird vs with new courage, &amp; beeing within ≈øhot of them our M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. commanded his Gunner to make his leuell &amp; to ≈øhoot, went clo≈øe by his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was neere≈øt vs, ≈øhot on purpo≈øe to mi≈ø≈øe him, as a warning what kind welcome<pb facs="tcp:24000:7"/>they were to haue at our hands at which the formo≈øt ≈øhip came vp to vs apace, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt becalmed, or with very little winde, returning vs wor≈øe then wee ≈øent for their fir≈øt ≈øhot kild vs a man, ≈øo betwixt vs for a good ≈øpace was a mo≈øt furious encounter, they hauing aduantage of vs by rea≈øon of the winde, pre≈øently layde vs a boord with one of their ≈øhippes, this was neere about eleauen of the clocke, then they ≈øounded their Trumpets, and gaue ≈øueh a ≈øhowt as if they had won the victory already.

            <p>Now for the third, there came one more of theirs ≈øhips of two hundred tunne that had 30. pieces of Ordinance, and at the lea≈øt two hundred and 50. men all well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as might be, which was as we thought too great a number for vs, beeing ≈øo few in our ≈øhip, but God that was our friend gaue vs ≈øuch ≈øtrength and ≈øucce≈ø≈øe that they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preuailed again≈øt vs, for at their fir≈øt comming vp, notwith≈øtanding all their multitude of men, wee ≈øhot her quite thorough and thorough, we entertaind her with two minion and three ≈øacre, on our ≈øtarboard ≈øide, then ≈øhe fell to our Larboard<pb facs="tcp:24000:10"/>≈øide, and then we welcom'd her with a ≈øacre in our bow, two minion and, one demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culuerin, which made her for≈øake vs and lye by the lee, as the others did before: but the other ≈øhip remaining, greater then the re≈øt, in burden 500. tunnes with 650. men, laid vs aboard on the Starbord ≈øide, and in that quarter they entred our ≈øhip, with their Semiters, Fauchions, halfe Pikes, and other weapons, running to and fro vpon the deck crying ≈øtill in the Turki≈øh tongue, and ≈øome Engli≈øh, yeeld your ≈øelues, promi≈øing we ≈øhould be well v≈øed, and one third part of our goods deliuered backe, with ≈øuch like faire promi≈øes; at which one of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny told, the Mai≈øter of the large offer of the Turkes, per≈øwading him to yeeld, but the Mai≈øter replied, away villaine, I will neuer giue them part or quarter, whil≈øt I haue quarters to my body.
